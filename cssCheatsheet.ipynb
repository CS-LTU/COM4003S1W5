    "### Basic Syntax:\n",
    "```css\n",
    "selector {\n",
    "  property: value;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selectors:\n",
    "- `*`: Universal selector, targets all elements.\n",
    "- `element`: Targets all elements of a specific type.\n",
    "- `.class`: Targets all elements with the specified class.\n",
    "- `#id`: Targets a specific element with the specified ID.\n",
    "- `element, element`: Grouping selector, targets multiple elements.\n",
    "- `element element`: Descendant selector, targets an element inside another element.\n",
    "- `element > element`: Child selector, targets direct children of an element.\n",
    "- `element + element`: Adjacent sibling selector, targets an element immediately after another element.\n",
    "- `element ~ element`: General sibling selector, targets all siblings of an element."

    "### Precedence \n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which styles are defined in CSS can matter due to the concept of **Cascading** in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cascade**: Styles are applied not just based on specificity and importance, but also based on the order they are defined in the stylesheet. If two selectors have the same specificity, the one that comes last in the CSS is the one that will be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specificity**: Each selector has a specificity value, and the styles from the selector with the higher specificity value will be applied. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes/attributes/pseudo-classes, and element names/pseudo-elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Importance**: The `!important` rule in CSS is used to make a particular property and value the most important and overrides any other declarations. However, using `!important` is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary, because it makes debugging more difficult by breaking the natural cascading in your stylesheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "p {\n",
    "    color: blue;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "p {\n",
    "    color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, even though there are two rules for `p` elements, all `p` elements will be red because the second rule comes after the first one, and they have the same specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if there's a rule with a higher specificity later in the stylesheet, that will override previous less-specific rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "p {\n",
    "    color: blue;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".special-text {\n",
    "    color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a `p` element with the class `special-text`, it will be red because class selectors have a higher specificity than element selectors, even though the rule for `p` elements is defined first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the order of CSS rules, specificity, and the cascade is crucial for writing effective CSS. It helps in making the styles predictable and easier to manage, especially in larger stylesheets."

    "**Examples** Selectors in CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Universal Selector `*`\n",
    "```css\n",
    "* {\n",
    "  margin: 0;\n",
    "  padding: 0;\n",
    "  box-sizing: border-box;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* This sets the margin and padding of all elements to 0, and ensures that padding and border are included in the total width and height of the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Element Selector\n",
    "```css\n",
    "h1 {\n",
    "  font-size: 2em;\n",
    "  color: #333;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* All `<h1>` elements (which could be used for the main title of the menu) are given a font size and color.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Class Selector `.class`\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".dish {\n",
    "  font-weight: bold;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".price {\n",
    "  float: right;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* All elements with the class `dish` are made bold (used for the names of the dishes), and all elements with the class `price` are floated to the right (to display the price of a dish on the same line as its name).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. ID Selector `#id`\n",
    "```css\n",
    "#specials {\n",
    "  background-color: yellow;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "#footer {\n",
    "  text-align: center;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* A section with the ID `specials` is given a background color (highlighting the specials section of the menu), and the footer of the page is centered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Grouping Selector\n",
    "```css\n",
    "h1, h2, h3 {\n",
    "  font-family: 'Georgia', serif;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".dish, .price {\n",
    "  margin-bottom: 10px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* All heading elements are given the same font family, and both dish names and prices have a margin at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Descendant Selector\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".menu-item .dish {\n",
    "  display: inline-block;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".menu-item .price {\n",
    "  display: inline-block;\n",
    "  width: 50px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* Within each menu item, the dish name and price are displayed inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Child Selector\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".menu > li {\n",
    "  list-style-type: none;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".header > .logo {\n",
    "  float: left;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* Direct list items under the menu are given a style, and a logo inside the header is floated to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Adjacent Sibling Selector\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".dish + .price {\n",
    "  margin-left: 20px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".header + .menu {\n",
    "  margin-top: 20px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* If a price directly follows a dish name, it is given a left margin. If a menu directly follows a header, it is given a top margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. General Sibling Selector\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".dish ~ .description {\n",
    "  font-style: italic;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".header ~ .section {\n",
    "  border-top: 2px solid #ccc;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Example:* Any description following a dish is italicized, and any section following the header is given a top border.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how you can use different types of selectors to style various parts of a restaurant menu."
